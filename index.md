# Welcome to CFPA Music Technology 2023-2024

STUDENTS: I am thrilled to start this school year! Whether you are a new or
returning student, you are in for a year of amazing collaborations and
experiences. You will learn and make music in four main areas: music writing, music production, audio engineering, and live performance. Yes, you will explore all of these this year, but there will also be tons of opportunities to focus on your passions!

My biggest piece of advice to you this year is this:

Take initiative.
