## Studio Classes

Studio Classes will be held monthly for all CFPA Music
Technology students.

### Attendance Policy
**Attendance is mandatory for all CFPA Music Technology students.** When a student must miss a studio class, they will be given an alternate assignment. Students not currently taking a music technology class will still need to complete an alternate assignment to satisfy CFPA requirements. Alternate assignments may include a performance in class or at a masterclass.

**CFPA Music Technology students not taking a music technology class must attend monthly Studio Classes and complete assigned projects.**

## End-of-Year and Senior Exit Projects

Each year, students will meet with their instructor to decide on their end-of-year project. It will usually consist of the release of original music, either as a production or live performance. Projects should reflect the student's absolute best abilities. The instructor may count another extensive activity as a End-of-Year Project, for example, scoring for film, composing for orchestra, or producing a music video.

Senior Exit Projects are required for each graduating member of CFPA Music Technology and usually feature a portfolio of each student's work over the course of the program. Each senior will meet with their instructor between Thanksgiving and Winter Break to discuss the timeline and details for their project.

## Other Activities Required (OARs)

The nature of music technology — both as a CFPA program and as a
profession — is that it is a multi-skill field. In addition to learning about gear, software, and running events, students in CFPA Music Technology are taught to be versatile musicians. Based on a student's interests, they may be asked to set up and run sound for other concerts, write a new song for an event, arrange a pop medley for an a cappella group, produce a track for the dance program, learn a rock band instrument, etc.

In short, we ask students to try on a lot of musical hats and then help them find their favorite ones.

Here's what one former student had to say:

> At first, I didn't know what I was getting into. Eventually I learned that I love arranging and recording music and I got pretty good at it! I didn't know how to use microphones, audio interfaces, DAWs, or anything before. I really think I will use these skills forever.

### OAR Options

1. Complete a Summer Music Tech Task.
1. Produce an original song by collaborating with at least one other CFPA Music Tech member.
